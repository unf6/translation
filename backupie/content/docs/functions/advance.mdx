### Create [Advanced]

You can use more options for backup creation:

```js
const backup = require("backupie");
backup.create(guild, {
    maxMessagesPerChannel: 10,
    jsonSave: false,
    jsonBeautify: true,
    doNotBackup: [ "roles",  "channels", "emojis", "bans" ],
    saveImages: "base64"
});
```

**maxMessagesPerChannel**: Maximum of messages to save in each channel. "0" won't save any messages.  
**jsonSave**: Whether to save the backup into a json file. You will have to save the backup data in your own db to load it later.  
**jsonBeautify**: Whether you want your json backup pretty formatted.  
**doNotBackup**: Things you don't want to backup. Available items are: `roles`, `channels`, `emojis`, `bans`.  
**saveImages**: How to save images like guild icon and emojis. Set to "url" by default, restoration may not work if the old server is deleted. So, `url` is recommended if you want to clone a server (or if you need very light backups), and `base64` if you want to backup a server. Save images as base64 creates heavier backups.

### Load [Advanced]

As you can see, you're able to load a backup from your own data instead of from an ID:

```js
const backup = require("backupie");
backup.load(backupData, guild, {
    clearGuildBeforeRestore: true
});
```

**clearGuildBeforeRestore**: Whether to clear the guild (roles, channels, etc... will be deleted) before the backup restoration (recommended).  
**maxMessagesPerChannel**: Maximum of messages to restore in each channel. "0" won't restore any messages.
